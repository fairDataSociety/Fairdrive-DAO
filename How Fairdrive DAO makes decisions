# Introduction

This document outlines the proposed decision-making process for Fairdrive DAO. Our goal is to foster an environment of collaboration, transparency, and efficiency in how we make and implement decisions. This process is designed to be adaptable and will evolve as our DAO grows.

## Communication Platforms

- **Internal Communication:** DAO members will use designated channels on FDS Discord for internal discussions and decision-making processes.
- **Public Communication:** The broader community discussions and public communications will take place at [https://forum.fairdatasociety.org/](https://forum.fairdatasociety.org/).

## Proposal Process

1. **Initial Consultation:** Gather input from DAO members through Discord discussions and forum posts. Ensure all voices are heard and considered.
2. **Involving Members in Proposals:** Before submitting a proposal that involves another DAO member, obtain their consent and ensure they are fully informed and involved in the process.
3. **Advisor Engagement:** As we do not currently have designated advisors, we will establish a set of guidelines for engaging with future advisors, focusing on their role, expertise, and the process of seeking their advice.
4. **Proposal Documentation:** When you have sufficient information and consensus, draft the proposal. This should be done using the Chat GPT project canvas template ([link to the template on HackMD included here](#)).
5. **Submission and Discussion on Murmur:** Submit your proposal on [murmur.com](http://murmur.com) for DAO members review. The proposal will undergo three rounds: Understand Round, Improve Round, and Decide Round. A brief guide to this process on Murmur is available [here](#).

## Voting and Ratification Process

- **Voting Philosophy:** Follow the “It’s Safe to Try” rule during voting. We prioritize agility and productivity over perfection. If a proposal is deemed safe and beneficial, even without unanimous agreement, it should be allowed to pass.
- **Ratification on Colony:** Successful proposals on Murmur are then ratified on the Colony platform. Create a new decision and include a comment with a link to the proposal document (publicly accessible via HackMD or Google Docs).
- **Transparency and Record-Keeping:** Post the link to the ratified decision on the forum under the categories “decision” or “motion”. This ensures transparency and provides an opportunity for any objections or further discussions.

## Community Updates

- **Progress Updates:** Regularly update the community on the progress of decisions and projects, using both Discord and the forum.

## Feedback Mechanism

To continuously improve our decision-making process, we will establish distinct feedback mechanisms for internal and public matters.

- **Internal Feedback:** DAO members will use Discord to provide feedback on internal decision-making processes, operational strategies, and collaborative dynamics. This will ensure that internal feedback remains easily accessible and can be discussed in a more immediate and informal setting.
- **Public Feedback:** For broader, community-related aspects and decisions impacting the public scope of Fairdrive DAO, feedback will be gathered on the forum at [forum.fairdatasociety.org](https://forum.fairdatasociety.org). This will allow for more structured and documented feedback from a wider audience, including external stakeholders.

## Emergency Decisions

For situations requiring urgent decision-making, the DAO will continue to utilize the Murmur Method to ensure consistency and collaborative input. However, the timeframes for each round - Understand, Improve, and Decide - will be significantly shortened to expedite the process. This adjustment allows the DAO to respond swiftly to time-sensitive matters while still adhering to our principles of inclusive and democratic decision-making. The specific duration of each shortened round will be predetermined and communicated to ensure clarity and efficiency during urgent scenarios.

## Amendments to the Process

- **Process Evolution:** This decision-making process is adaptable. Proposals for amendments can be initiated by any DAO member and will follow the same procedure of discussion, voting, and ratification.

# Conclusion

This proposal is intended to lay a foundation for a structured yet flexible decision-making process within Fairdrive DAO. It is designed with the principles of inclusivity, transparency, and efficiency at its core. We look forward to evolving this process together with the active participation and feedback of our community.
